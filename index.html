                    <p>Our goal is for a deliberate collecting strategy in which clients appreciate the artist’s work and are comfortable with the market.</p>

                    <p>We collaboratively plan a collecting strategy and maintain a continuing conversation as our clients’ collections and experiences with art grow. For new collectors our initial focus is on developing a critical eye for the most enjoyable collecting experience. With established collectors, we make them aware of new opportunities and continue to build the collection based on their interests.</p>

                    <p>With roots in high-end art advisory and galleries, we bring world-class service to all client projects -- large and small. Our expertise is deep, from small works in editions to monumental commissioned site-specific art works and we bring our passion to each client project. From accompanying clients on their first studio visit to the final installation, we handle each appointment and detail with precision.</p>

                    <p>With over ten years experience, we have indepth knowledge of successful artwork at every price point. Whether we find work at artist’s studios, private dealers, galleries or international auction houses, we are able to connect clients with with art they love.</p> 

                    <p>At the heart of our firm is the belief that supporting artists and living with art is important.</p>
